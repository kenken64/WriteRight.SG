## 2. Assessment Truth Model (Locked)

### 2.1 Score Schema — Aligned to MOE 1184 Syllabus

#### Situational Writing (Section B) — Total: 30
| Dimension | Max Marks | MOE Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Task Fulfilment | 10 | Addressing required points, purpose/audience/context, use of given info |
| Language | 20 | Organisation, clarity of expression, accuracy |

#### Continuous Writing (Section C) — Total: 30
| Dimension | Max Marks | MOE Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Content & Development | 10 | Relevance, depth, engagement |
| Language & Organisation | 20 | Expression, vocabulary, grammar, structure |

### 2.2 Banding (per MOE 1184 descriptors)

#### Situational Writing — Task Fulfilment (out of 10)
| Band | Marks | Descriptor |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 9-10 | All points addressed and developed in detail; purpose/audience/context fully addressed |
| 4 | 7-8 | All points addressed with one or more developed; purpose/audience/context clearly addressed |
| 3 | 5-6 | Most points addressed with some development |
| 2 | 3-4 | Some points addressed; partially addressed context |
| 1 | 1-2 | One point addressed; occasionally addressed context |
| 0 | 0 | No creditable response |

#### Situational Writing — Language (out of 20)
| Band | Marks | Descriptor |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 17-20 | Coherent and cohesive; effective use of ambitious vocabulary; complex grammar used accurately |
| 4 | 13-16 | Coherent with some cohesion; varied vocabulary and grammar; mostly accurate |
| 3 | 9-12 | Most ideas coherent; vocabulary varied enough to convey meaning; often accurate |
| 2 | 5-8 | Some ideas coherent; mostly simple vocabulary; meaning usually clear |
| 1 | 1-4 | Ideas in isolation; simple vocabulary; few correct examples |
| 0 | 0 | No creditable response |

### 2.3 Marking Output Contract
- Required per submission:
  - **Per-dimension score + band + justification** with direct quotes from student text
  - 3 strengths — each citing a specific passage
  - 3 weaknesses — each citing a specific passage with suggested improvement
  - 3 actionable next steps — concrete and specific to this essay (no generic advice)
  - Confidence score (0-1) for OCR and marking
  - Review recommended flag when low confidence or OCR ambiguity
- **Feedback quality rules:**
  - Every piece of feedback MUST reference the student's actual text
  - No contradictions between strengths and weaknesses
  - No generic comments (e.g. "try to use more varied vocabulary" without examples)
  - Provide a rewritten example for each weakness

### 2.4 Model Version Tracking
- Every evaluation records: `rubricVersion`, `modelId`, `promptVersion`, `timestamp`
- Score comparisons only valid within same rubric+model version
- Dashboard flags when historical scores used a different version
- Model/prompt changes require re-benchmarking against calibration set before deployment

## 12. Built-in Essay Editor with AI Writing Coach

### 12.1 Overview
A Tiptap-based rich text editor where students write essays directly in the app, with a real-time AI assistant that coaches them as they write. The AI helps students write better — it does NOT write for them.

### 12.2 Writing Modes
| Mode | Timer | AI Assistant | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Practice** | Off | Full assistance | Learning & improving |
| **Timed Practice** | Configurable (30/45/60 min) | Limited hints | Exam prep |
| **Exam Simulation** | Strict (matches O Level timing) | OFF | Mock exam |

### 12.3 AI Assistance Features
- **🔴 Real-time live scoring** — AI continuously estimates score + band as student writes, updated after every paragraph. Shows per-dimension breakdown (Task Fulfilment, Language) with specific tips to reach next band. Score progression sparkline shows improvement during the session. Uses GPT-4o-mini for <3s latency.
- **Passive analysis** (always-on, background): structure tracker, tone checker, word count pacing, repetition detector, real-time grammar highlights
- **Smart suggestions** (on pause/paragraph end): opening strategies, vocabulary upgrades, transition words, pacing warnings, conclusion prompts
- **Ask the Coach** (student chat): student types questions, AI responds with strategies and examples — never writes full text for them
- **Inline grammar** (Grammarly-style): red underline for grammar/spelling, yellow for weak vocab, orange for run-ons, blue for excessive passive voice
- **Outline builder** (pre-writing): scaffolded essay structure with AI-suggested points
- **"To reach next band"** — live actionable tips: "Address point 3", "Fix 3 grammar errors", "Use more varied vocabulary"

### 12.4 Anti-Cheating Guardrails
- AI never writes full sentences — only strategies and examples
- AI panel text is non-selectable / copy-disabled
- Max 10 suggestions + 15 chat messages per essay
- Exam mode = AI completely OFF
- All AI interactions logged — parent can review transparency log
- Adaptive assistance: less help for stronger students (Band 4-5)

### 12.5 Tech: Tiptap Editor
- Headless, extensible, React-native
- JSON document model — easy to store/version in Supabase
- Custom extensions for grammar highlights and word count
- Auto-save every 30s with draft versioning
- Collaborative-ready for Phase 2 (tutor commenting)

See `ESSAY_EDITOR.md` for full specification including data model, API, and component structure.

- Achievements visible on student's profile (shareable badge wall)
- **No leaderboards** — competition is against yourself, not others (pedagogy-first)

### 12.4 Kid's Wishlist

**How it works:**
1. Kid adds items they want to their wishlist (up to 10 items)
2. Parent reviews and tags each item with an **achievement requirement**
3. When the achievement is unlocked, the item becomes **claimable**
4. Parent gets notified → fulfils the reward

**Wishlist item types:**
- 🎁 **Custom rewards** (parent-defined): "Ice cream outing", "30 min screen time", "$10 pocket money"
- 🎮 **Pre-built templates**: Treat 🍦 | Screen Time 🎮 | Book 📖 | Activity 🏊 | Money 💰 | Creative 🎨
- 🫣 **Surprise rewards**: Parent can hide rewards that appear only when earned (delight factor)

**Reward tier suggestions:**
- **Small** (practice milestones): Treats, screen time ($0-10)
- **Medium** (improvement milestones): Books, outings ($10-30)
- **Large** (mastery milestones): Big items, experiences ($30+)

### 12.5 Prize Redemption & Parent Promise Tracking

**The accountability loop:**
```
Kid earns achievement → Claims wishlist item → Parent has 7 days to fulfil
→ Escalating nudges if overdue → Promise Score tracks history
```

**Redemption states:**
| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔒 Locked | Achievement not yet earned |
| 🔓 Claimable | Achievement earned, kid can claim |
| 📋 Claimed | Kid claimed, waiting for parent |
| ⏳ Pending Fulfilment | Parent acknowledged, in progress |
| ✅ Completed | Parent fulfilled, kid confirmed receipt |
| ⚠️ Overdue | Past 7-day fulfilment deadline |
| 🔄 Rescheduled | Parent set new deadline with reason |
| ❌ Withdrawn | Parent cancelled with mandatory reason |

**Parent accountability nudges:**
| Day After Claim | Notification |
|---|---|
| Day 0 | "🎁 Aiden claimed 'Nintendo Switch game'! Fulfil within 7 days." |
| Day 3 | "⏰ Reminder: 4 days left to fulfil Aiden's reward" |
| Day 5 | "⚠️ 2 days left. Keep the promise!" |
| Day 7 | "🚨 Reward is now overdue. Aiden can see this." |
| Day 14 | "❗ Overdue for a week. This affects motivation." |

**Kid-side features:**
- Promise Tracker: "Dad promised: Nintendo Switch game 🎮 — Claimed 3 days ago ⏳"
- Confirm receipt button: "I got it! 🎉" → moves to trophy case
- Gentle nudge (1x per day max): "Hey, just a reminder about my reward! 😊"
- If overdue: shows ⚠️ but **no shaming language** — just "Still waiting..."

**Parent Promise Score (parent dashboard only, not shown to kid):**
- Tracks: `fulfilled_on_time / total_claimed`
- Display: "Your Promise Score: 87% ✅ (7 of 8 fulfilled on time)"
- Coaching nudges:
  - < 70%: "Tip: Smaller, frequent rewards work better than big rare ones."
  - < 50%: "Your child may lose motivation if rewards aren't fulfilled."

**Fulfilment options:**
- ✅ Mark as fulfilled (optional photo proof — fun memory!)
- 🔄 Reschedule with new deadline + reason (kid sees reason)
- ❌ Withdraw with mandatory reason (kid keeps the achievement badge)

### 12.6 Student Motivation UX
- **Badge wall** — earned achievements in color, locked ones greyed with progress bars
- **"Next achievement" spotlight** — closest one to unlock
- **Post-submission nudges**: "You're 3 submissions from 'Dedicated Writer'!"
- **Score improvement nudge**: "Your score went up 4 marks! Keep going for 'Levelling Up'!"
- **Streak alerts**: "🔥 5-day streak! 2 more days for the 7-day badge!"
- **Trophy case** — all fulfilled rewards with dates and optional parent photos
- **Confetti/animation** on new achievement unlock

### 12.7 Parent Reward Dashboard
- Wishlist Manager — view kid's wishes, set/modify achievement requirements
- Achievement Timeline — all earned achievements with dates
- Pending Rewards — items ready to fulfil
- Reward History — past rewards, total value, monthly spend trend
- Promise Score — fulfilment rate + coaching tips

## 13. Error States & UX

| Scenario | User Sees | Action |
|---|---|---|
| OCR fails completely | "We couldn't read your handwriting. Try retaking the photo with better lighting." + guided recapture tips | Retry upload |
| OCR low confidence | OCR text shown with highlighted uncertain words + "Please review and correct" | Manual correction editor |
| Marking times out | "Taking longer than usual. We'll notify you when ready." | Background processing + push notification |
| Upload fails mid-way | "Upload interrupted. X of Y images saved." + Resume button | Resume from last successful chunk |
| Recheck score differs significantly | "Our recheck found a different result. Here's a comparison." | Show both evaluations side-by-side |
| Rate limit (free tier) | "You've used 3/3 free submissions this month. Upgrade for unlimited." | Upgrade CTA |

## 14. KPI Instrumentation Plan

### 14.1 Core KPI Events
- topic_generated (source, essayType)
- assignment_created
- submission_uploaded
- ocr_completed (confidence)
- manual_correction_used
- evaluation_completed (score, band, confidence)
- rewrite_viewed
- rewrite_copied (if enabled)
- recheck_requested
- onboarding_demo_completed
- subscription_started (plan)
- subscription_renewed
- subscription_canceled (reason)
- achievement_unlocked (achievement_code, student_id)
- wishlist_item_added (student_id, reward_type)
- reward_claimed (student_id, item_id, achievement_code)
- reward_fulfilled (parent_id, redemption_id, days_to_fulfil)
- reward_fulfilled_late (parent_id, redemption_id, days_overdue)
- reward_rescheduled (parent_id, redemption_id)
- reward_withdrawn (parent_id, redemption_id, reason)
- kid_nudge_sent (student_id, redemption_id)
- kid_confirmed_receipt (student_id, redemption_id)
- promise_score_dropped (parent_id, new_score)
- streak_milestone (student_id, days)
- streak_broken (student_id, was_days)

### 14.2 KPI Formulas
- Monthly active students: unique students with evaluation_completed in month / active student base
- Avg submissions per student: total submission_uploaded / active students
- Score improvement (3 months): (latest 30-day avg - baseline 30-day avg) / baseline
- Free-to-paid conversion: subscriptions started / signups (by cohort, 30-day window)
- Renewal rate: renewals / subscriptions due
- NPS: promoter-detractor survey at day 45 and day 120

### 14.3 Operational Dashboards
- Funnel: topic → assignment → upload → OCR → evaluation → rewrite viewed
- Quality: OCR accuracy sample audits, human-marker agreement, feedback contradiction rate
- Reliability: latency percentiles, failure rates, recheck volumes

## 15. Risk Register (Owners, Triggers, Mitigations)

1. **OCR accuracy too low on poor photos**
   - Owner: ML Lead
   - Trigger: OCR confidence median <0.8 for 7 days
   - Mitigation: image-quality precheck, guided recapture UI, manual correction prominence

2. **Marking inconsistency vs teachers**
   - Owner: Assessment Lead
   - Trigger: exact band agreement <70% monthly
   - Mitigation: rubric prompt calibration, sampled human moderation, model rollback path

3. **Student over-reliance on rewrite**
   - Owner: Product Lead
   - Trigger: rewrite viewed rate high but score improvement flat for 2 cycles
   - Mitigation: reflection prompts, rationale-first reveal, optional rewrite delay mode

4. **Parent trust risk from incorrect feedback**
   - Owner: CX Lead
   - Trigger: complaint rate >2% of active paid accounts/month
   - Mitigation: recheck workflow, confidence transparency, escalation support queue

5. **Data privacy incident**
   - Owner: Security Lead
   - Trigger: unauthorized access alert or audit anomaly
   - Mitigation: strict RBAC tests, encryption, audit trails, incident playbook + notification workflow

6. **Slow feedback under load**
   - Owner: Platform Lead
   - Trigger: p95 >5 min for 3 consecutive days
   - Mitigation: queue autoscaling, job prioritization, OCR/model batching

7. **Low conversion from free to paid**
   - Owner: Growth Lead
   - Trigger: conversion <8% after 2 cohorts
   - Mitigation: paywall optimization, clearer value in analytics/rewrite, onboarding nudges

8. **Model/prompt drift degrading quality**
   - Owner: ML Lead
   - Trigger: benchmark scores drop >5% after model/prompt update
   - Mitigation: mandatory re-benchmark before deployment, version tracking, rollback capability

- Rewrite + side-by-side comparison
- Basic parent analytics (30/90 day)
- Free/paid billing (Stripe)
- Notification preferences (email + web push)
- **Achievements** — practice, improvement, mastery, streak badges with progress bars
- **Wishlist** — kid adds items, parent sets achievement requirements, claim flow
- **Redemption tracking** — 7-day fulfilment deadline, escalating nudges, parent promise score
- **Kid confirmation** — "I got it!" receipt flow, trophy case

### Phase 2
- Tutor role + student management
- Custom rubrics

## 17. Open Decisions to Confirm Before Build Start

1. ~~Final score scale: keep 30 or move to 50 for school familiarity~~ **→ Keep 30, aligned to MOE 1184**
2. Chinese in MVP: keep pilot-only or GA at launch
3. Reflection gate: mandatory for all students or configurable by parent
4. Pricing: confirm $14.90/month or adjust based on market research
5. News sources for auto topic generation: which SG outlets to scrape/license?
6. Calibration essay set: who scores them? Hire ex-MOE markers or partner with tuition centres?
